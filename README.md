# Platform Import Keystore
My own version of [keytool-importkeypair](https://github.com/getfatday/keytool-importkeypair)

This script doesn't need a keystore pre created counter to keytool-importkeypair

# Installing
Add platform_import_keystore to your PATH

# Usage
<pre>
usage: platform_import_keystore [-k keystore pass] [-p key pass] [-a key alias]
</pre>

# Note

If your certificat (.x509.pem) of private key (.pk8) are not nammed "platform.x509.pem" or "platform.pk8" you can edit the field in the script directly.
